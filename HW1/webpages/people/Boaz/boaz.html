            <p class="uneven-paragraph">
                My name is <strong class="flex-ignore">Boaz Roskam</strong>, and I turned 20 years old this year.
                I am still living at home in Gouda with my family,
                which consists of 2 parents, one older brother, 2 younger brothers and my dog.
                I am studying informatica at the University of Utrecht, currently following Web tech and Databases.

                I have liked sports ever since I was young.
                I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football" class="flex-ignore"> rugby </a> for a while and now I go to the gym twice a week.
                Besides this I also like hanging out with friends and playing video or board games with them.
                Nothing better than having a beer and playing a few board games with friends. Furthermore,
                I love spending time with my girlfriend or brothers.
                I often play games with my brothers, and I spend every weekend with my girlfriend.

            <h3 class="title">My school carreer</h3>
            <p class="uneven-paragraph">
                It’s been almost 8 years since I started high school. I started at VWO, and I fitted well there.
                I got good grades in general, although I had a hard time with other languages like French or Latin.
                But still I was going to make it if I worked hard enough. This was until the Corona period came.
                I had a really tough time learning online and I felt behind fast.
                After this I was too much behind on a subject what resulted in me going to the HAVO.
                I did have an easy time there and I got my diploma with a nice grade list.
                After this I started my HBO informatica.
                I found out this was to easy so after I got my Propedeuse, I applied for this university.

                The dog is young and has mostly black hair, but a bit of white on her belly">

                Since 3 months ago we have a dog at home. 
                Her name is Nala. She is a mix between an Australian Shepard and a Pomsky. 
                She is a very enthusiastic dog and is always very excited when we come home. 
                She is still very young, about 5 months, so she can also be very stubborn. 
                I love going on walks with her, and since a while, 
                we make a long walk every morning where she can spend all her energy. 
                It has been very nice having her around.
