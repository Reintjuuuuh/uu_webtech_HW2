                My name is <strong class="flex-ignore">Rein Spaan</strong>. I was born in Amsterdam, then moved to Blaricum, and now I'm looking for student housing in Utrecht (please let me know if you know someone xD).    
                My school career has been a little rough; I have been to three elementary schools, two high schools, and who know what'll happen in college.
                I have a little brother and sister, and we have a lot of <a class="flex-ignore" href="#pets">pets</a>.

                I have a lot of things that I really like to do. You can ask me along with pretty much any activity and I'll probably enjoy it, but if I had to name a few things they would be bouldering, playing piano, cooking, and basically anything tech related.

            <p class="uneven-paragraph">
                As stated, my school career was a little rocky. I started in Amsterdam at the "Geert Grote School", but I quickly transfered to the BAS in Badhoevedorp because the education there was a better fit for me. A couple years later there were some financial problems at this school which meant I had to transfer again. This time to the "Horizon" in Amsterdam. 
                After this I went to high school at "VOX College" in Amsterdam North. To be brief: this was a dumpsterfire, and I really quickly burned out. I transfered (again, yay) to the "SG Huizermaat" in Huizen, were I really felt at home. Here, I got my VWO diploma, with a cum laude mark. 
                After high school I immediatly started with Computer Science at Utrecht University. Its pretty good so far, so I think I'll stick around :).

                My family really enjoys having a lot of pets for some reason.
                We have, and had, a lot of pets. Right now we have 2 cats, 2 bunnies, 6 chickens, and a lot of fish. <br><br>
                In the past we have also had another cat and, on two seperate occasions, we have had multiple rats.
