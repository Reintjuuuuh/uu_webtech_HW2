### Description
Develop a static website about your group. Use the Web-representation technologies and apply standards and
best practices discussed during Lectures 2 and 3 (HTML5, CSS3, accessibility, responsive design, SEO, good coding
style, etc.). The visual  appeal of your design is highly welcomed but no strict requirements are specified. Yet, please,
avoid deliberately repulsive color combinations. Your website  is expected to present meaningful information about the
members of the group. The pages should be bigger than a paragraph, but smaller than a book chapter.
### Requirements

### Maintain good coding style

  -  use quotation marks for attribute values
  -  ! always use alt attribute with img elements
  -  ! use meaningful names for CSS classes
  -  ! follow the BEM naming convention for CSS classes
  -  short CSS rules can be written on one line, but long rules need to occupy multiple lines
  -  ! use lower case file names
  -  ! make sure your website has a clear and logical file structure (index.html, meaningful names of files and folders)

### Procedure

  -  complete and submit your website in groups 
  -  ! the website should be archived and submitted as a single zip through the BlackBoard system

### Academic integrity
The work should be done by you and your peers only. You can rely on the support of teaching assistants and student
assistants during the practicum time, but you are not allowed to use the code of other groups. It is also forbidden to use
HTML generating services and programs. You are required to manually create both the HTML and the CSS code. You can
use external sources for the content of your website, however, you must refer to them by linking and naming.
